    <h1>Introduction To HTML</h1>
    <p>
      The web, <em>invented in 1990</em> is composed largely of HTML documents.
      HTML stands for <b>Hypertext Markup Language</b> and is the language the browsers use to interpret web pages.
      HTML is used to create electronic documents (called pages) that are displayed on
      the <a href="http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/w/www.htm">World Wide Web</a>.
      We use <b>HTML tags</b> to create a simple HTML document that a browser can display as a web page.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Basically HTML is made up of :-<br></b>
      1) Text content<br>
      2) Markup<br>
      3) Refrences<br>
      4) Links to other pages<br>
    </p>
    <h2>HTML Markup</h2>
    <p>
      <h3><em><u>HTML Tags</u></em></h3>
        Most HTML elements consist of an opening and a closing tag with some content between them.<br>
        Its like :-
        <div class="row">
        <b>< TAG NAME (Opening) > Contents < /TAG NAME (Closing) ></b><br><br>
        </div>
        <em>For example,</em><br><br>
        <b>< b></b> text <b>< /b></b>  -  b is for bold and it makes the 'text' content <b>bold</b>.<br>
        <b>< em></b> text <b>< /em></b>  -  em is for emphasis and it makes the 'text' content <em>italic</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3><em><u>HTML Attributes</u></em></h3>
      Some elements accept additional values called attributes in their opening tags.
      Attributes provide additional information to the browser.<br>
      Its like :-
      <div class="row">
      <b>< TAG NAME ATTR(attribute name) = "value" > Contents < /TAG NAME ></b><br><br>
      </div>
      <em>For example</em>,<br><br>
      <b>< a></b> tag - The <b>anchor tag</b> takes an attribute called <em>href</em> that defines a URL to
      <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp">link</a> - Creates a hyperlink to the href attribute value url and names it link.
      <h3><em><u>Adding Images</u></em></h3>
      <b>< img></b> tag - <br> <br> <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-gQqU36aB4pI/VPdtoQugvlI/AAAAAAAAAJM/_8vTcrovWQM/h120/4268841912_c447b34284_o.jpg" alt="html logo"> <br><br>
      Its like :-
      <div class="row">
      <b>< img src="url" alt="text"></b><br><br>
      </div>
      Displays the image hosted at the src attribute value "url" (this can also be a path to a local file on your computer).<br>
      If the image cannot be displayed, then the alt attribute value "text" is shown.<br>

      <h2>Whitespace</h2>
      HTML takes all text as one line, pressing enter makes no difference. So to input text in next line we use two tags specificly :-<br>
      1) <b>< br></b> tag - br stands for break. The text entered after this tag comes in the next line. Moreover, it is a void tag i.e. having no closing.<br>
      2) <b>< p></b> tag - p stands for paragraph. The text in this tag comes in form of paragraph. And, it is not void tag i.e. we need to close this tag.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3><u>Inline vs Block Elements</u></h3>
      In HTML, all the spaces between some text comes in just one single space, so we put a < br> tag there which is <em>inline</em>. <br>While < p> tag is <em>block</em> i.e. makes a invisible
      box around text which is having height and length.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h2>Document Structure</h2>
      Writing code that people can easily read is a <em>VERY</em> important idea in computer programming. And a huge part of writing good code is structuring it well.
      If you've ever written an English essay, you're familiar with the purpose of <em>indenting</em> every paragraph.
      In HTML particularly, the indentation level increases when an idea begins and decreases when an idea is finished.
      let's look at this example :-<br><br>
      <img src="C:\Users\Hp Notebook\Desktop\Capture.png" alt="image of html str"><br><br>
